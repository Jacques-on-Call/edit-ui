<p>This folder contains the pages that are all about action. These are the pages we want to lead people to when they are ready to make a decision and move forward.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-create-here">What to create here:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Pages:</strong> Detailed pages that describe our services and their benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Special Offer Pages:</strong> Landing pages for promotions, discounts, or special deals.</li>
<li><strong>“Contact Us” or “Request a Quote” Pages:</strong> Pages with clear calls-to-action for getting in touch.</li>
<li><strong>Sign-Up Pages:</strong> Pages where users can sign up for a newsletter, a trial, or an account.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of these pages is to make it as easy and appealing as possible for a visitor to take the next step. The language should be clear, direct, and persuasive.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Linking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These pages are the final destination in the customer journey. They should be linked from relevant “Consider” hub pages.</li>
<li>Avoid linking out to “Discover” or “Consider” pages from here, as we want to keep the user focused on the action we want them to take. An exception might be a link to a case study or testimonial that supports the decision to act.</li>
</ul>
