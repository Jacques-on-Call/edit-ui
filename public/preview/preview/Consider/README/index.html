<p>This folder is the home for our “hub” pages. Think of these pages as central train stations, connecting many different lines. They bring together various related topics into one comprehensive guide.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-create-here">What to create here:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hub Pages:</strong> These are in-depth pages that cover a broad topic. A good practice is to have one hub page for each of your main services or offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison Guides:</strong> Pages that compare different products, services, or approaches, helping visitors weigh their options.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Centers:</strong> Collections of links to helpful articles, tools, and other resources on a specific subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The content in this folder is for people who have a general understanding of a topic and are now looking to go deeper and evaluate their choices.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Linking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “Consider” hub page should link out to many related “Discover” pages. This builds authority and provides a comprehensive resource for the visitor.</li>
<li>These pages should also guide the visitor towards the final step of their journey by linking to relevant “Get” pages (e.g., service pages, special offers).</li>
</ul>
