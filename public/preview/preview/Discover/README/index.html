<p>This folder is for all the content that helps people who are just starting to explore a topic. Think of these pages as the friendly “welcome” signs to a new subject.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-create-here">What to create here:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beginner’s Guides:</strong> Pages that break down a topic in simple, easy-to-understand terms.</li>
<li><strong>“What is…?” Articles:</strong> Content that answers the most fundamental questions someone might have.</li>
<li><strong>Explanatory Blog Posts:</strong> Posts that explore a subject from many different angles, answering every potential question a newcomer might have.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the content in this folder is to be helpful and educational. We want to provide value to our visitors by answering their questions and helping them understand the landscape of a topic.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Linking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These “Discover” pages should link to each other when they cover related topics.</li>
<li>Most importantly, a group of related “Discover” pages should all link up to a central “Consider” hub page, guiding the visitor to the next step in their journey.</li>
</ul>
