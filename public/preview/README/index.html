<p>Welcome to the <code>general</code> folder! This is where all the visitor-facing pages of the website are stored. Think of it as the main filing cabinet for your website’s content.</p>
<p>To keep things organized, we’ve divided this folder into a few key sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>General Pages:</strong> Right here in the main this folder, you’ll find the essential pages for the site, such as the homepage, about us, contact us, and privacy policy. These are the pages that don’t fit into a specific customer journey stage but are crucial for any website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subfolders for Specific Needs:</strong> We also have subfolders to organize content based on where a visitor is in their journey with us. This helps us create a clear path for them, from their first visit to becoming a customer.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>discover/</code>: For content that helps people who are just starting to learn about a topic.</li>
<li><code>consider/</code>: For “hub” pages that connect various topics, aimed at users who are evaluating their options.</li>
<li><code>get/</code>: For pages designed to encourage users to take a specific action, like making a purchase or signing up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By organizing our pages this way, we can create a more intuitive experience for our visitors and a more streamlined workflow for our content creators.</p>
