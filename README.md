## Editor Redesign & Two-Mode Workflow (250923)

-   **What:** A complete redesign of the editor to create a more intuitive, mobile-first, and non-technical user experience. The system is now split into two distinct modes:
    1.  **Writing Mode:** A clean, distraction-free editor with a white background and a blue header/footer. The editor toolbars are fixed to the header and footer, and the content area is the primary focus.
    2.  **Settings Mode:** A "Search Preview" modal launched from the file viewer. This modal contains all page and section metadata, including a live preview of how the page will appear in search results, character counters for SEO fields, and an input to edit the URL slug.
-   **Why:** The previous editor design was not meeting user expectations. It was cluttered, the distinction between body and metadata was unclear, and it lacked user-friendly features for SEO. This redesign separates the concerns of writing and configuration, providing a better experience for both.
-   **How:**
    -   The main layout was implemented in `Editor.css` using a flexbox model to create the fixed header/footer and scrolling content area.
    -   The TinyMCE editor in `SectionEditor.jsx` was reconfigured to be a pure rich-text editor. Its main toolbar is now rendered into the parent's `.editor-header` using the `fixed_toolbar_container` option.
    -   The `HeadEditor.jsx` component was significantly enhanced to include the new slug field, character counters, and a sub-form for editing the metadata of each individual page section.
    -   The file publishing logic in `FileViewer.jsx` was refactored to handle file renaming. When a user changes the slug and publishes, the component now creates the new file, deletes the old one, and navigates the user to the new URL.
-   **Where:**
    -   `react-login/src/Editor.jsx`: Refactored to be a simple layout container with a header, content area, and footer.
    -   `react-login/src/Editor.css`: Rewritten to implement the new "blue header/footer on white background" layout.
    -   `react-login/src/SectionEditor.jsx`: Refactored into a pure rich-text editor with a new TinyMCE toolbar configuration.
    -   `react-login/src/HeadEditor.jsx`: Heavily modified to include slug editing, character counters, and section metadata forms.
    -   `react-login/src/FileViewer.jsx`: Updated to handle the complex logic of publishing with a potential file rename.
-   **Thoughts & Suggestions:**
    -   **Bottom Toolbar:** The user requested a bottom toolbar with specific tools. TinyMCE's support for a *fixed* bottom toolbar is limited. I used the main top toolbar to house all essential items for now to ensure stability. A future improvement would be to build a custom React component for the footer that uses the TinyMCE API to apply formatting, which would provide full control over the layout and content of the bottom bar.
    -   **Component Complexity:** `FileViewer.jsx` and `HeadEditor.jsx` have grown in complexity. They could be broken down into smaller, more specialized components (e.g., `useFileActions` hook for publishing/renaming, `SectionMetadataForm` component within `HeadEditor`) to improve maintainability.
-   **Questions & Challenges:**
    -   **Environment Instability:** The development sandbox environment presented significant challenges, particularly with "sticky working directories" that made running scripts via `cd` unreliable. Using `npm run <script> --workspace=<workspace>` was a necessary and effective workaround.
    -   **Tooling File Access:** The verification workflow was hampered because the `read_image_file` and `frontend_verification_complete` tools could not access temporary files created by the `run_in_bash_session` tool. This prevented direct visual confirmation of screenshots within the agent's context.

# Editor Debugging & Refinement (250921)

This log documents the work being done to debug, enhance, and redesign the TinyMCE editor, starting on 250921.

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Logging

To diagnose why the editor may not be functioning correctly in the deployment environment, extensive logging has been added to `src/Editor.jsx`.

*   **What:** Added detailed `console.log` statements prefixed with `DEBUG:` throughout the component's lifecycle.
*   **Why:** This will trace the complete flow of data, from initialization and API calls to content parsing and rendering within the TinyMCE instance. This is a necessary first step to understand the root cause of the issue.
*   **Next Steps:** The application should be deployed with these changes. The browser's developer console logs will need to be captured and analyzed to identify the point of failure.

---

# Tiptap to TinyMCE Migration (250921)

This section documents the migration from the Tiptap editor to the TinyMCE editor, including the rationale and the new data pipeline implementation.

---

### Developer Notes: The "Why"

The previous Tiptap implementation was built around a custom, brittle data pipeline.

*   **Old System:** It did not edit Markdown or HTML directly. Instead, it converted a proprietary JSON structure, stored in a `contentBlocks` key inside the file's YAML frontmatter, into a Tiptap-compatible format. This meant it was incapable of editing the content of standard `.md` files or the HTML content within `.astro` files, which was the primary goal.
*   **New System:** The new implementation using TinyMCE removes the `contentBlocks` abstraction entirely and works with file content directly. It detects the file type and uses a robust data pipeline:
    *   For **`.astro` files**, it extracts the HTML from the `content` fields in the `sections` array, allows editing, and then reconstructs the file.
    *   For **`.md` files**, it uses the `marked` library to convert the Markdown body to HTML for the editor, and the `turndown` library to convert the HTML back to Markdown on save.

This new approach is more flexible, more robust, and directly supports the project's actual file formats.

---

### Migration Plan

This was the phased plan followed for the migration.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Tiptap Removal**
The goal of this phase was to remove all legacy Tiptap code and integrate a basic, functional TinyMCE editor.
*   **Update Dependencies:** Remove all `@tiptap/*` packages and add `@tinymce/tinymce-react`, `marked`, and `turndown`.
*   **Cleanup Old Code:** Delete obsolete files (`converter.js`, `Toolbar.jsx`, `extensions/`).
*   **Basic TinyMCE Integration:** Add the TinyMCE CDN script to `index.html`.

#### **Phase 2: Implement New Data Pipeline (Load & Save)**
This phase focused on correctly reading and writing to `.astro` and `.md` files.
*   **Refactor File Loading:** The `useEffect` hook in `Editor.jsx` was rewritten to detect file type. It now parses `.astro` file YAML to extract HTML from `sections`, or uses `marked` to convert the body of `.md` files to HTML.
*   **Refactor File Saving:** The `handleSave` function was rewritten. It now takes the HTML from TinyMCE and either updates the YAML structure for `.astro` files or uses `turndown` to convert the HTML back to Markdown for `.md` files.

#### **Phase 3: Configure the Editor UI/UX**
With the data pipeline functional, this phase configured the editor to match the user's minimalist, mobile-first vision.
*   The TinyMCE `init` object was configured with the specified plugins, toolbar, and with the menubar disabled to provide a clean writing experience.

# Architect's High-Level Debugging Analysis (250920)

**Note from Jules, Software Architect:** This analysis was conducted on 250920 to provide a fresh, high-level perspective on the state of the `react-login` project. It is intended to guide future developers by summarizing the architecture and highlighting the most critical areas for attention. The detailed historical log below this section is invaluable and should be read for context.

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

This project is a sophisticated **frontend-only application** designed to interact with a separate, proprietary **backend service**.

-   **Frontend:** A React Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Vite. It handles the user interface for file exploration and content editing.
-   **Backend (External):** The backend is hosted at `https://edit.strategycontent.agency`. It manages the entire GitHub OAuth2 flow, session management (via `HttpOnly` cookies), and all interactions with the GitHub API.

**Key Implication:** The frontend cannot run standalone. For local development, the `vite.config.js` is correctly configured to proxy all `/api` requests to the production backend. However, any work on the authentication flow itself will be difficult to test without access to the backend's logic or logs.

## 2. Key Areas of Concern & Recommendations

The codebase is functional, but several underlying issues pose significant risks to future development, stability, and maintainability.

### a. Configuration Management

-   **Issue:** The OAuth `REDIRECT_URI` is hardcoded in `src/App.jsx`. This tethers the application to the production domain and complicates local testing or deployment to a staging environment.
-   **Recommendation:** Convert the `REDIRECT_URI` into an environment variable (e.g., `VITE_REDIRECT_URI`), similar to how `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is handled. This is the single most important change to improve the developer experience.

### b. Authentication Flow

-   **Potential Bug:** In `src/App.jsx`, the CSRF state cookie is set with `SameSite=Lax`. For cross-origin OAuth redirects, this should almost certainly be `SameSite=None; Secure`. This is a potential bug that could cause the login to fail under specific browser conditions.
-   **UX Improvement:** The flow relies on `window.location.reload()` after a successful login. A more modern approach would be to update the application's state in place, providing a smoother user experience without a full page refresh.

### c. Dependency Management & Build Process

-   **Symptom:** The `build` script in `package.json` (`rm -rf node_modules && ...`) is a forceful workaround, not a solution.
-   **Root Cause:** The `README.md` history strongly suggests this project is part of a larger monorepo (with an Astro project at the root). The aggressive build script is likely necessary to resolve conflicting dependencies or a corrupted `package-lock.json` between the two projects.
-   **Recommendation:** The dependency issues are a major source of friction. A proper fix would involve setting up a formal monorepo using tools like **npm workspaces** or **pnpm**. This would resolve the dependency conflicts, stabilize the build process, and eliminate the need for the aggressive build script.

### d. Environment Stability (Critical Risk)

-   **Issue:** The `README.md` contains numerous reports of a **highly unstable development environment**. This includes file changes being silently reverted, inconsistent shell behavior, and tools failing without clear cause.
-   **Recommendation:** This is the **highest priority risk** for any developer. Before attempting significant feature work, the stability of the development and deployment environment must be investigated. The current state has led to lost work and regressions, and it will continue to do so until the root cause is found and fixed. It is unclear if the issue lies with the sandbox environment, the Cloudflare build cache, or the monorepo dependency conflicts, but it must be addressed.

---

## Monorepo Stabilization & UI Bug Squashing (250921)

This section documents the work done by agent Jules to stabilize the monorepo environment and fix critical UI bugs.

### The Problem: A Tale of Two Reacts

The primary source of instability in this project was a fundamental dependency conflict between the root Astro project and the `react-login` workspace.

*   **What:** The root project used `astro-decap-cms`, which required an older version of React (~18.x). The `react-login` app was built on React 19.
*   **Why:** This conflict caused `npm install` to fail with numerous peer dependency warnings, leading to an unstable `node_modules` directory. This was the true root cause of the issues previously attributed to an unstable development environment.
*   **How:** The user clarified that `decap-cms` is being deprecated. This allowed us to solve the problem by completely removing the `astro-decap-cms` dependency from the root `package.json`.

After removing the conflicting package, we successfully set up the project as a formal **npm workspace**. This unified the dependency management and created a stable foundation for future development.

### UI Bug Fixes

With a stable environment, two critical UI bugs were addressed:

1.  **Broken Search:**
    *   **Symptom:** Search was returning no results.
    *   **Root Cause:** A data mismatch between the backend and frontend. The backend worker at `/api/search` returned a direct JSON array of results, but the frontend component (`src/search-bar.jsx`) was incorrectly expecting an object with a `.items` property (i.e., `data.items`).
    *   **Fix:** The frontend was corrected to handle the array directly (`setResults(data || [])`), immediately fixing the search functionality.

2.  **"Create New" Modal Failures:**
    *   **Symptom:** The modal showed a "Failed to create item" error.
    *   **Root Cause:** The component (`src/CreateModal.jsx`) was sending empty content for new files, which is rejected by the GitHub API. It also lacked the logic to automatically append the `.astro` extension, a feature that was previously implemented but had been lost in a prior update.
    *   **Fix:** The modal logic was rewritten to:
        *   Automatically append `.astro` to filenames if not already present.
        *   Provide a default placeholder content (`---\n# Add your frontmatter here\n---\n\n# Start your content here\n`) for all new files, satisfying the GitHub API requirement.
        *   Correctly handle file creation in the repository root.

### Questions for Future Developers

*   **TinyMCE Integration:** The user mentioned a future goal of integrating TinyMCE. How will this interact with the existing TipTap editor pipeline? Will it replace it, or will they coexist?
*   **Astro Project Dependencies:** With `decap-cms` removed, are there other dependencies in the root `package.json` that are no longer needed for the Astro site? A review could simplify the project further.

# CURRENT STATUS & FINAL SOLUTION (As of 2025-09-16 02:38)

Thank you for the latest error report. The information you provided is excellent news, as it proves you have successfully deployed the new frontend code. The login URL is now correct (`...&state=...`) and no longer contains the old `code_challenge` parameter.

The final remaining error, `The redirect_uri is not associated with this application`, is a simple configuration issue within your GitHub account settings.

### The Final Step

To resolve this, please follow the instructions already documented below in the "Deployment & Troubleshooting" section, under the heading **"Issue: 'redirect_uri is not associated with this application'"**.

You must ensure the "Authorization callback URL" in your GitHub OAuth App settings is set to this **exact** value:
`https://edit.strategycontent.agency/callback`

There cannot be any typos or a trailing slash (`/`).

Once you correct this one setting in your GitHub account, the login will work.

# GitHub OAuth Login for React SPA

This project implements a secure GitHub OAuth2 login flow for a React Single-Page Application (SPA). It uses a Cloudflare Worker as a backend proxy to handle the token exchange securely, avoiding exposure of the client secret on the frontend.

## The Problem and The Solution

The primary challenge in implementing this flow was a subtle but critical mismatch between the frontend and backend authentication protocols. Previous attempts used the **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** flow, which is designed for native apps or SPAs *without* a secure backend. However, because this architecture uses a secure Cloudflare Worker, the correct and more robust approach is the **standard OAuth 2.0 Web Application Flow**.

This codebase has been refactored to correctly implement the standard Web Application Flow.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **Frontend Protocol:** The React application (`App.jsx`, `Callback.jsx`) no longer uses PKCE. Instead, it uses a `state` parameter for CSRF protection.
2.  **Backend Protocol:** The corresponding backend logic (provided in `cloudflare-worker-code.js`) was written to handle this standard flow, exchanging the temporary `code` and the `client_secret` for a valid `access_token`.
3.  **Secure Session Management:** The backend worker establishes a user session by setting a secure, `HttpOnly` cookie containing the access token. This is the recommended practice for SPAs with a backend, as it prevents the token from being accessed by client-side JavaScript, mitigating XSS risks.

---

## Architecture Overview

The authentication process works as follows:

1.  **Login Initiation (`App.jsx`):** The user clicks "Login with GitHub". A popup window is opened, directing the user to the GitHub authorization URL. A randomly generated `state` value is stored in `sessionStorage` and included in the URL.
2.  **User Authorization (GitHub):** The user approves the authorization request on GitHub.
3.  **Callback (`Callback.jsx`):** GitHub redirects the user's popup to the `redirect_uri` (e.g., `/callback`). This component retrieves the `code` and `state` from the URL parameters.
4.  **State Verification:** The `state` from the URL is compared with the `state` from `sessionStorage`. If they match, the flow continues. If not, it's aborted to prevent CSRF attacks.
5.  **Code-for-Token Exchange (Backend Worker):** `Callback.jsx` sends the `code` to the `/api/token` endpoint on the Cloudflare Worker.
6.  **Secure Token Handling (Backend Worker):** The worker receives the `code`, adds the `client_id` and `client_secret` (stored as secrets in Cloudflare), and sends a `POST` request to GitHub to get the `access_token`.
7.  **Session Creation (Backend Worker):** Upon receiving the `access_token`, the worker sets it in a secure, `HttpOnly` cookie (`gh_session`) in the user's browser. This cookie is scoped to the worker's domain.
8.  **Confirmation (`Callback.jsx` -> `App.jsx`):** The worker sends a success response to `Callback.jsx`. `Callback.jsx` then uses `window.opener.postMessage` to notify the main application window that login was successful.
9.  **Fetch User Data (`App.jsx`):** The main app, upon receiving the success message, makes a `GET` request to the `/me` endpoint on the Cloudflare Worker. Because this request is sent with `credentials: 'include'`, the browser automatically attaches the `gh_session` cookie.
10. **Authenticated API Call (Backend Worker):** The worker's `/me` endpoint reads the token from the cookie and uses it to make an authenticated request to the GitHub API to fetch the user's profile, which it then returns to the frontend.

## User Experience Features

The file explorer is designed with a mobile-first, user-friendly interface.

-   **Breadcrumb Navigation:** A header at the top of the screen shows the current folder path (e.g., `Home > Decide`), allowing for easy navigation back to parent directories.
-   **Floating Action Button (FAB):** A prominent `+` button is fixed to the bottom-right of the screen, providing a consistent and accessible way to create new files and folders.
-   **File-Specific Icons:** To make content easily scannable, different icons are used for different file types:
    -   `📁` for folders
    -   `🖼️` for images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`)
    -   `📝` for markdown files
    -   `💻` for code files (e.g., `.js`, `.astro`)
    -   `📄` for other text files
-   **Responsive Toolbar:** The bottom toolbar adapts to screen size. On narrow mobile screens, it displays icons only, preventing layout issues and ensuring all buttons are visible.
-   **Formatted File Names:** File names are cleaned up for display. For example, `about.astro` is shown as `About`.
-   **File Metadata:** Each file tile displays the author of the last change and how long ago it was made (e.g., "Jacques, 2h ago"), providing at-a-glance context. This data is fetched securely through the backend worker.

---

## UX Enhancements (250918-ux-improvements)

As part of a major UX overhaul, the following features were implemented to improve the look, feel, and functionality of the file explorer.

### 🎨 Visual Redesign & Hierarchy

*   **Folder vs. File Differentiation:** To improve scannability, folders and files now have distinct visual treatments.
    *   **Folders:** Styled with a soft blue background and a subtle border to make them stand out as containers.
    *   **Files:** Kept neutral with a light grey background to keep the focus on the content.
*   **SVG Icon Set:** All icons in the application have been replaced with a clean, minimalist SVG icon set (Feather Icons). This provides a more professional and consistent look across all devices compared to the previous emoji-based icons.

### 🧭 Navigational Improvements

*   **Contextual "Up" Button:** The "Up" button in the main toolbar is now more intuitive. Instead of just saying "Up," it displays the name of the parent folder (e.g., "Up to 'services'"), giving users better spatial awareness within the file tree.
*   **Header and Breadcrumbs:** The header continues to provide a clear breadcrumb trail for easy navigation back to any parent directory.

### 🔍 File & Content Search

*   **Backend Search API:** A new, efficient search endpoint (`/api/search`) was added to the Cloudflare Worker. It leverages the official GitHub Search API to quickly find files by filename or by matching text within the file's content.
*   **Frontend Search UI:** A search bar has been integrated into the application's header.
    *   **Live Results:** As you type, a debounced search is performed, and results appear in a clean dropdown list.
    *   **Clear Context:** Each search result displays the filename and its full path, so you know exactly where the file is located.
    *   **Direct Navigation:** Clicking a search result takes you directly to that file.

**Note for Next Developer:** There appears to be a file persistence issue in the development environment. The files `Icon.jsx`, `Search.css`, and `Search.jsx` were created in the `react-login/src/` directory, but they are not being correctly recognized by the code review system. Please verify these files exist and are correctly imported before proceeding with further development.

---

## Technical Details of the Cloudflare Worker

The reference implementation is in `cloudflare-worker-code.js`. It is designed to be deployed as a Cloudflare Worker.

### Required Environment Variables:
The worker requires the following secrets to be configured in the Cloudflare dashboard:
-   `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Your GitHub OAuth App's Client ID.
-   `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your GitHub OAuth App's Client Secret.

### Endpoints:
-   **`POST /api/token`**: Expects a JSON body with a `code` property. Handles the OAuth token exchange and sets the session cookie.
-   **`GET /api/me`**: Reads the session cookie and uses the token to fetch and return the authenticated user's GitHub profile.
-   **`GET /api/repos`**: Fetches the authenticated user's repositories from GitHub.
-   **`GET /api/files`**: Fetches the contents of a directory in a given repository. Requires query parameters `repo` and `path`.
-   **`GET /api/file`**: Fetches the content of a single file. Requires query parameters `repo` and `path`.
-   **`POST /api/file`**: Creates or updates a file in a given repository.
-   **`DELETE /api/file`**: Deletes a file in a given repository.
-   **`OPTIONS /*`**: Handles CORS preflight requests from the browser, which are necessary for cross-domain communication between the SPA and the worker.

### Cookie Security:
The session cookie (`gh_session`) is set with the following flags:
-   `HttpOnly`: Prevents access from client-side JavaScript.
-   `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
-   `SameSite=None`: Required for the browser to send the cookie in cross-origin requests (i.e., from your SPA's domain to the worker's domain). Note: `SameSite=None` also requires the `Secure` flag.
-   `Path=/`: Makes the cookie available across the entire worker domain.
-   `Max-Age`: Sets an expiration time for the session (e.g., 1 day).

---

## Deployment & Troubleshooting

After making code changes, you may still encounter errors if the new code is not yet deployed or if the GitHub App configuration is incorrect.

### Issue: "redirect_uri is not associated with this application"
This error from GitHub means that the callback URL in your GitHub OAuth App settings does not exactly match the one the application is using.

-   **Solution:**
    1.  Go to your [GitHub OAuth App settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).
    2.  Find the field named **"Authorization callback URL"**.
    3.  Ensure it contains this **exact** value: `https://edit.strategycontent.agency/callback`
    4.  It must match perfectly. There can be no typos and **no slash at the end**.

### Issue: Login still fails, or old behavior is observed
If you see behavior consistent with old versions of the code (e.g., a `code_challenge` parameter appearing in the GitHub URL), it means your browser is still running the old, cached frontend code.

-   **Solution:**
    1.  **Build the project:** Navigate to the `react-login` directory in your terminal and run `npm run build`.
    2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:** This will create a `dist` (or `build`) folder. You must upload the contents of this folder to your Cloudflare Pages site that powers `edit.strategycontent.agency`.
    3.  **Clear Browser Cache:** After deploying, it's a good practice to clear your browser's cache or perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) on your site to ensure you are loading the latest version.

### Issue: Client ID Mismatch
The frontend application code reads its GitHub Client ID from an environment variable set by the hosting platform (Cloudflare Pages). If this variable does not exactly match the Client ID used by the backend worker and configured in GitHub, the login will fail.

-   **Solution:**
    1.  Go to your **Cloudflare Pages** settings for your site (`edit.strategycontent.agency`).
    2.  Navigate to **Settings > Environment variables**.
    3.  Ensure you have a variable named `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`.
    4.  Ensure its value **exactly matches** the `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` used by your worker and configured in your GitHub OAuth App (e.g., `Ov23li6LEsxbtoV7ITp1`).
    5.  If you make a change, you must **re-deploy** the Pages site for the new variable to take effect.

---

## Debugging

This project includes `vConsole`, a powerful on-screen debugging tool, to help diagnose issues directly on any device, especially mobile.

### Activating the On-Screen Console

To activate the debugger, append the `?debug=true` query parameter to the URL.

-   **Example:** `https://edit.strategycontent.agency/?debug=true`

When activated, a green "vConsole" button will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Tapping it will open a full-featured console with tabs for logs, network requests, storage, and more.

### Key Feature: Debugging the Popup

A critical feature is that `vConsole` is also injected into the GitHub login popup window. This allows you to see console logs and network requests that are happening *inside* the popup, which is essential for debugging the token exchange process. When the popup appears, `vConsole` will be active there as well.

---

## A Note on Authentication Architecture (Standard Web Flow vs. PKCE)

There are two primary, secure methods for handling OAuth2 authentication for an application like this: the Standard Web Application Flow and the PKCE flow. It is critical that the frontend and backend are using the same method.

### 1. Standard Web Flow (This Project's Implementation)

*   **How it Works:** This is the industry-standard flow for applications with a **secure backend** (like a Cloudflare Worker). The backend proves its identity to GitHub using a `client_secret` that is never exposed to the browser. Security is guaranteed because the secret is stored and used exclusively on the server.
*   **Recommendation:** This is the recommended path for this project. The frontend code in this repository has been built to use this flow, and it should be paired with the matching backend worker provided in `cloudflare-worker-code.js`.

### 2. PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) Flow

*   **How it Works:** This flow was designed for applications **without a secure backend** (e.g., mobile apps, pure SPAs). It adds an extra client-side verification step to compensate for the absence of a server-side secret. The `auth-worker` directory in the parent repository contains a worker that uses this flow.
*   **Security:** Both flows are considered highly secure when implemented correctly. The choice depends on the application's architecture. Since this project has a secure worker, using the Standard Web Flow is a more direct and traditional architecture.

### The Most Important Thing: Consistency

The login will fail if the frontend and backend are using different methods.

*   This `react-login` frontend speaks the **Standard Flow**.
*   The `auth-worker/index.js` in the root directory speaks **PKCE**.
*   The provided `cloudflare-worker-code.js` speaks the **Standard Flow**.

To ensure success, the frontend in this directory must be paired with a backend that also uses the Standard Web Flow.

## Developer & Agent Collaboration Notes

To ensure smooth collaboration and prevent accidental data loss, please adhere to the following guidelines:

*   **A Note for Future Agents:** Be aware you may run into issues beyond your control with the development environment returning unstable errors. If this occurs, document the symptoms and actions taken in the log below.
*   **Deletion Policy:** Do not delete any files, or remove any content from this `README.md`, without explicit confirmation from the project owner.
*   **Branch Naming:** To improve traceability, all branches should follow the naming convention `yymmdd-descriptive-name` (e.g., `250916-update-readme-guidelines`).

## UI Redesign & Dependency Woes (250919)

This section documents the UI redesign based on user feedback and the subsequent dependency issues that arose.

### **The Goal: A Modern, Apple-Inspired UI**

The objective was to refactor the file explorer's UI to be more modern, clean, and in line with Apple's design principles. The key requests were:
1.  **Modernize the Search Bar:** Make it more subtle and integrated.
2.  **Two-Column Mobile Layout:** Display files and folders in a two-column grid on mobile portrait view.
3.  **Redesign the Bottom Toolbar:**
    *   Move the 'Create' button to the center of the toolbar, styled as a prominent, floating-style button.
    *   Remove the 'Open' and 'Duplicate' buttons to simplify the UI.
    *   Replace the breadcrumb navigation in the toolbar with a simple "Home" icon and the current folder's name.
4.  **Polish File Tiles:** Give the file and folder tiles a cleaner, more consistent look.

### **The Implementation: A CSS & JSX Overhaul**

*   **Search Bar (`search-bar.css`):** The search bar was restyled to have a softer, borderless look with a light grey background, making it less intrusive.
*   **File Grid (`FileExplorer.css`):** The grid system was updated to use fixed column counts for different screen sizes (`repeat(2, 1fr)` for mobile), ensuring a consistent two-column layout as requested.
*   **Toolbar (`FileExplorer.jsx`, `FileExplorer.css`):** The bottom toolbar was significantly refactored.
    *   The JSX was restructured into a three-part flex container (`left`, `center`, `right`) to ensure the 'Create' button was perfectly centered.
    *   The 'Open' and 'Duplicate' buttons were removed from the JSX.
    *   The `MiniBreadcrumb` component was removed and replaced with a `<span>` containing the current folder's name.
    *   CSS was added to style the 'Create' button as a circular, elevated button that overlaps the toolbar.
*   **File Tiles (`FileTile.css`):** The tiles were given a transparent background, removing the distinction between file and folder backgrounds. The folder icon is now colored with an accent color to differentiate it. Typography was also refined for a cleaner look.

### **The Struggle: Dependency Hell**

A significant amount of time was spent trying to get the development server running to verify the changes. The root cause was a missing dependency, `@tiptap/extension-image`, which was required by `Editor.jsx`.

*   **The Problem:** Adding the missing dependency caused a cascade of peer dependency conflicts with the other `@tiptap` packages, which were on an older version.
*   **The Solution:**
    1.  Updated all `@tiptap` packages in `package.json` to the same version (`^2.5.0-rc.1`).
    2.  Deleted `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to ensure a clean installation.
    3.  Ran `npm install` to fetch the correct, compatible versions of all packages.
*   **The Environment Issues:** Even after fixing the dependencies, I encountered persistent issues with the `run_in_bash_session` tool, which prevented me from starting the dev server. The tool seemed to have an issue with sticky working directories and would fail with "Missing script: dev" errors, even though the script was present. Due to these environment issues, I was unable to visually verify the final design.

## Worker Bug Fix (250919)

This section documents a critical bug fix for the Cloudflare worker.

### **The Problem: Mismatched Delete Request**

The Cloudflare worker was failing to process file deletion requests. The issue was a mismatch in how the frontend sent the request and how the backend expected to receive it:
*   **Frontend (`FileExplorer.jsx`):** Sent the `path` and `sha` for the file to be deleted as **URL query parameters**.
*   **Backend (`cloudflare-worker-code.js`):** Expected the `path` and `sha` to be in the **JSON body** of the request.

This resulted in the worker being unable to find the required parameters, causing the delete operation to fail with a 400 error.

### **The Solution: Aligning the Backend**

The fix was to modify the `handleDeleteFileRequest` function in `cloudflare-worker-code.js` to parse the `path` and `sha` from the URL's search parameters, aligning it with the frontend's implementation. This was a one-line change to the worker's code and resolved the issue.

## Cloudflare Build Cache Issues (250919)

This section documents a persistent issue with the Cloudflare build environment and the workaround that was implemented.

### **The Problem: Stale Dependencies**

The Cloudflare build process was repeatedly failing due to missing dependencies, even after they were correctly added to the `package.json` file. This indicated that the build environment was using a cached version of the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file, which did not include the new dependencies.

### **The Solution: Forcing a Clean Install**

To resolve this, the `build` script in `react-login/package.json` was modified to force a clean installation of all dependencies before running the build. The new script is:

```json
"build": "rm -rf node_modules && rm -f package-lock.json && npm install && vite build"
```

This ensures that the latest dependencies are always used, bypassing any potential caching issues in the build environment.

## UI Resurrection & Styling (250920)

This section documents the work done to fix the broken UI, align it with the target design, and address several underlying issues.

### **The Goal: A Modern, Apple-Inspired UI**

The file explorer was initially rendering as a blank screen. The goal was to fix the underlying issues and implement a clean, modern, and intuitive UI based on the Apple design philosophy and a user-provided screenshot.

### **The Diagnosis: Corrupted CSS and Environment Woes**

The investigation revealed several critical issues:
1.  **Corrupted CSS Files:** Multiple key CSS files (`FileExplorer.css`, `search-bar.css`, `FileTile.css`) were corrupted and contained HTML error messages instead of styles. This was the primary reason for the unstyled and "broken" appearance of the UI.
2.  **Dependency Issues:** While `package.json` was correct, a clean installation was required to resolve latent dependency conflicts.
3.  **Environment Instability:** The development server was difficult to start due to shell environment issues ("sticky working directories"), requiring direct execution of the Vite binary to bypass the `npm run dev` script.
4.  **Outdated Icon Implementation:** The `FileTile.jsx` component was using text-based emoji icons instead of the intended SVG icon system.

### **The Solution: A Step-by-Step Resurrection**

1.  **Stabilize the Environment:**
    *   Performed a clean `npm install` after deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
    *   Bypassed the "Missing script: dev" error by calling the Vite executable directly.
2.  **Rebuild the UI:**
    *   Bypassed the login flow by temporarily modifying `main.jsx` and `ExplorerPage.jsx` to render the file explorer directly, allowing for iterative UI development.
    *   Rewrote the corrupted CSS files (`FileExplorer.css`, `search-bar.css`, `FileTile.css`) from scratch, using the user's screenshot as a visual guide.
    *   Refactored the `FileTile.jsx` component to use the project's shared `Icon.jsx` component, replacing the hardcoded emojis with SVGs.
    *   Incorporated the brand's primary color into the new stylesheets for brand consistency.
3.  **Restore and Document:**
    *   Reverted the changes to `main.jsx` and `ExplorerPage.jsx` to restore the original authentication flow.
    *   Documented the entire process in this README section for future developers.

### **Current Status**

The file explorer UI is now visually complete and functional, matching the target design. The underlying dependency and styling issues have been resolved. The application is ready for real-world testing with a proper user login to populate the file grid with data.

## UI Regression Fixes (250920)

This section documents the fixes implemented to address several UI regressions that were identified after the initial redesign.

### **The Regressions**

After the UI resurrection, several issues were reported:
1.  **Broken Search:** The search functionality was no longer displaying results.
2.  **Missing Styles:** The intended styles for SVG icons (size, color) and metadata text were not being applied.
3.  **Incorrect Selection Color:** The selection highlight was not using the correct brand colors for files vs. folders.
4.  **Context Menu Issues:** The long-press context menu was still triggering the native browser text selection menu.

### **The Investigation and Solutions**

*   **Missing Styles:** The investigation revealed that the previous attempt to apply the corrected CSS styles had failed to save correctly. The primary fix was to **re-apply the correct styles** to `FileTile.css`, which resolved the issues with SVG icon size/color, metadata spacing, and selection colors.
*   **Broken Search:** The search results dropdown was being hidden by other UI elements. This was fixed by increasing the `z-index` of the `.search-results` class in `search-bar.css`.
*   **Context Menu:** The issue with the native text selection menu was resolved by adding `user-select: none;` to the `.file-tile` class, preventing the browser from interpreting a long press as a text selection event. The positioning was also corrected in `FileExplorer.jsx` to use page-relative coordinates.
*   **Build Integrity:** A major underlying issue was discovered where running `npm install` only within the `react-login` directory created an inconsistent `package-lock.json`, breaking the root project's Astro build. The solution was to delete the incorrect lockfile and run `npm install` from the project root, which generated a unified and correct lockfile for the entire project.

### **Current Status**

All reported UI regressions have been addressed. The application now correctly displays the modern UI, and the build process is stable. The component is ready for use.

## Invisible Modal Button Fix (250920) - Second Attempt

This section documents the investigation and resolution of a persistent bug where the "Create" button in the "Create New" modal was not visible. This is the second attempt to fix this issue, as the initial fix was not successful.

### **The Problem: An Invisible, but Clickable, Button**

The "Create" button in the `CreateModal.jsx` component was not visible. However, further testing by the user revealed that the button *was* present in the DOM and could be clicked, triggering an API error. This confirmed the button was being rendered but was transparent.

### **The Investigation & Failed First Attempt**

The initial investigation correctly identified that the button was using an undefined CSS variable (`--accent-color`) for its background. The first attempt to fix this was to define `--accent-color` in the global `App.css` file.

However, this fix did not work in the user's testing environment. This indicates a more complex issue, likely related to the build process or aggressive browser/CDN caching, where the updated `App.css` file (with the new variable) was not being correctly applied to the `CreateModal` component.

### **The Solution: A More Robust, Direct Fix**

To eliminate any potential issues with the CSS variable pipeline or caching, a more direct and robust solution was implemented:

1.  **Bypass CSS Variable:** The `background-color` for the `.btn-create` class in `CreateModal.css` was changed to use a hardcoded hex value (`#006300`) instead of `var(--accent-color)`.
2.  **Ensure Consistency:** The hex code `#006300` was taken from the `--green` variable in `App.css` to ensure the button's color matches the application's existing design system.

This approach removes the dependency on the CSS variable system for this specific component, making the styling more resilient and virtually immune to the caching issues that were likely preventing the first fix from working.

### Multi-Section Editor & Draft Workflow (250922)

-   **What:** A complete overhaul of the editing experience to support a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) interface for both Astro and Markdown files, underpinned by a robust auto-saving draft system.
-   **Why:** The previous editor was not user-friendly and did not meet the user's goal of editing content in a document-like manner. There was no protection against data loss from accidental navigation or crashes. The user explicitly requested a "Google Docs" like experience with auto-saving.
-   **Where:**
    -   `react-login/src/Editor.jsx` (Major Refactor)
    -   `react-login/src/SectionEditor.jsx` (New Component)
    -   `react-login/src/FileViewer.jsx` (Major Refactor)
    -   `react-login/src/Editor.css` & `react-login/src/FileViewer.css` (New Styles & Mobile Polish)
-   **How:**
    1.  **Section-Based Editing:** A new `SectionEditor.jsx` component was created to render a dedicated editor for each object in an Astro file's `sections` array. This allows for modular editing of the page's content, preserving the structure.
    2.  **Auto-Save to Drafts:** The `Editor.jsx` component was refactored to automatically save all changes to a draft in the browser's `localStorage`. This happens on a debounced timer, ensuring minimal performance impact while providing strong data loss protection.
    3.  **Draft-Aware Preview:** The `FileViewer.jsx` component was updated to first check for a local draft. If one exists, it renders the draft content and displays a "Publish" / "Discard" UI, giving the user full control over their unpublished changes.
    4.  **State Management Fix:** A critical bug was fixed in the `SectionEditor` where it was not correctly updating when its props changed (an "uncontrolled component" bug). This was resolved by using a `ref` to the TinyMCE instance and manually setting its content, ensuring the UI is always in sync with the application's state.
    5.  **Mobile UI Polish:** Based on user feedback, multiple iterations of UI fixes were applied to ensure the editor and viewer are fully responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices. This included adjusting padding, margins, button sizes, and simplifying the editor toolbar for narrow screens.
-   **Thoughts & Questions:**
    -   The development and verification process was significantly hampered by an unstable sandbox environment, particularly with the shell's working directory and `npm` dependency installation. Stabilizing this environment is the highest priority for future development to improve efficiency and reliability.
    -   The current `SectionRenderer.jsx` is quite basic. A future improvement would be to build out this component to accurately render all possible section types (e.g., `hero`, `cta`), providing a true 1-to-1 preview of the final page.
    -   The `SectionEditor.jsx` could be enhanced to allow users to add, remove, and reorder sections, turning it into a true "block editor".

## UI Refinement & Fixes (250920)

This section documents the work done to address user feedback, fix a major UI regression, and resolve a critical bug in the "Create New" modal.

### **The Goal: A Polished and Functional UI**
The objective was to fix several issues reported by the user after a series of unstable updates. The key tasks were:
1.  **Fix UI Regression:** Restore all the "Apple-inspired" UI refinements that were lost, including icon colors, file-type specific icons, and layout spacing.
2.  **Fix Create Modal:** Correct the "Create New" modal, which was missing its "Create" button and had flawed logic.
3.  **Refine Iconography:** Ensure `.astro` files were treated as documents (paper icon), not code (`<>` icon).

### **The Implementation: A Full Restoration**

After a series of environment-related issues that caused previous changes to be lost, a full restoration of all features was required. This was done by systematically overwriting the relevant files with their correct and final content.

*   **`FileTile.css`:** The stylesheet for file/folder tiles was overwritten to restore the correct icon coloring (blue for folders, green for files via the `.is-folder`/`.is-file` classes) and the increased `margin-bottom` for better spacing.
*   **`icons.jsx`:** The icon library was overwritten to re-introduce the full set of file-type specific icons (`file-text`, `image`, `code`) that had been lost.
*   **`FileTile.jsx`:** The component was overwritten to restore the `getIconNameForFile` logic, which correctly assigns icons based on file extension (including mapping `.astro` to `file-text`).
*   **`CreateModal.jsx`:** This file was overwritten with a fully functional version that includes:
    *   A visible "Create" button to allow form submission.
    *   Corrected logic to only append the `.astro` extension to files, not folders.
    *   An `alert()` to confirm successful creation.
    *   More descriptive UI text for a better user experience.

### **The Struggle: A Hostile and Unreliable Environment**

This task was dominated by severe and persistent issues with the development environment. These issues were the root cause of the UI regression and the multiple failed attempts to fix the "Create" modal.

*   **The Problem:** The agent's workspace was unstable. Changes made to files were being silently reverted, leading to a state where the local files appeared correct to the agent's tools (`read_file`), but were not being correctly included in commits. This created a frustrating loop where fixes were implemented but never reached the user.
*   **Key Symptoms:**
    *   `npm install` failures due to peer dependency conflicts in the monorepo.
    *   Unreliable shell commands (`cd` failing).
    *   File patch/write tools (`replace_with_git_merge_diff`, `create_file_with_block`) appearing to succeed, but the changes not persisting in the final commit.
*   **The Solution:** The only successful method for applying changes was to use the forceful `overwrite_file_with_block` command for every single affected file in sequence. This "scorched earth" approach was necessary to bypass the environment's state-management flaws and ensure the final commit contained the correct code.

### **Questions for Future Developers**

*   **Environment Stability:** The primary question is how to create a stable local development environment for this project. The root-level dependency conflicts between the Astro site and the React app need to be resolved. Can this be done with `npm workspaces` or a similar monorepo tool?
*   **Toolchain Reliability:** Why were file modifications being silently reverted? Understanding this is key to trusting the development tools in the future. A thorough investigation into the sandbox or container setup may be required.

## Search Functionality Fix (250920)

This section documents the debugging and resolution of a critical bug where the in-app search was returning no results.

### **The Problem: A Dysfunctional Search**

The primary issue reported was that the search feature was completely non-functional. Searching for terms that were known to exist in file contents and filenames (e.g., "let's chat" or even "let") would consistently return "No results found." This indicated that the search API was being called successfully but was returning an empty set, rather than an error.

### **The Investigation: A Journey of Incorrect Hypotheses**

The debugging process was complex and involved several incorrect theories before the root cause was identified.

1.  **Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect): Restrictive Query.** My first attempt involved making the search query *more* restrictive by wrapping the search term in double quotes (`"${query}"`). The rationale was to improve phrase searching. This was incorrect and likely exacerbated the problem.
2.  **Second Hypothesis (Incorrect): CSS `z-index` Issue.** The `README.md` mentioned a previous "Broken Search" issue caused by a low `z-index`. I investigated `search-bar.css` and found that the `z-index` was already set to a high value (`100`), ruling this out.
3.  **Third Hypothesis (Incorrect): Path Filtering.** I then theorized that the `path:src/pages` filter was too restrictive or syntactically incorrect. A diagnostic test was attempted to remove this filter, but this was hampered by a misunderstanding of the testing workflow (I learned that I must submit changes for the user to test, making small, iterative diagnostics impossible).

### **The Solution: The `in:file,path` Qualifier**

After reverting all previous changes and carefully re-examining the original `cloudflare-worker-code.js` and the GitHub API documentation, the true root cause was identified.

*   **What:** The original search query was only searching within file **content**.
*   **Where:** The bug was located in the `handleSearchRequest` function within `cloudflare-worker-code.js`.
*   **How:** The original query string was constructed as `` `${query} in:file repo:${repo} path:src/pages` ``. The `in:file` qualifier explicitly told the GitHub API to *only* look at file content.
*   **Why:** The fix was to change this qualifier to `in:file,path`. This instructs the API to search in **both** the file content and the file path, which includes the filename. This aligns with the user's requirements and provides a comprehensive search. The final, correct query is: `` `${query} in:file,path repo:${repo} path:src/pages` ``.

### **Struggles & Learnings for Future Developers**

*   **Trust the `README`:** The `README.md` for this project is incredibly detailed. The clue about the `z-index` fix, even though it wasn't the current problem, was a valuable part of the debugging process. Always read it carefully.
*   **Test Workflow:** A key learning was that changes are not testable by the user until they are submitted via a pull request. This makes small, iterative diagnostic changes impractical. Future fixes should be developed with a higher degree of confidence before submission.
*   **Start with the Basics:** The bug was not in a complex part of the system, but in a single word in the API query. When debugging, it's often best to revert to the original state and question the most basic assumptions about the code's functionality.

### **Open Questions**

*   **Search Snippets:** The GitHub Search API can return snippets of the matching text within a file. The frontend could be enhanced to display these snippets in the search results, providing users with more context about why a particular file was returne

### End-to-End Viewer and Editor Fix (250922)

-   **What:** A comprehensive fix for the entire file viewing and editing workflow. This addressed a series of cascading bugs, from the initial "string did not match the expected pattern" error to UI/UX problems and a critical data corruption bug.
-   **Why:** The core functionality of the application was broken. Users could not open, edit, or save files correctly. The UI was unfinished, and the data flow between the frontend and backend was inconsistent and buggy.
-   **Where:**
    -   `cloudflare-worker-code.js` (Backend)
    -   `react-login/src/FileViewer.jsx` (Frontend)
    -   `react-login/src/Editor.jsx` (Frontend)
    -   `react-login/src/SectionRenderer.jsx` (New Component)
    -   `react-login/src/FileViewer.css` (New Styles)
-   **How:** The solution involved a multi-stage process of debugging and fixing:
    1.  **Backend Unification:** The `/api/file` endpoint was refactored to be the single source of truth, consistently returning the full JSON object (with Base64 content and SHA) from the GitHub API. This resolved data inconsistencies between the viewer and editor.
    2.  **File Viewer Overhaul:** The `FileViewer` was transformed from a simple text display to a smart component that parses `.astro` frontmatter and uses the new `SectionRenderer` to display the content of the `sections` array. It was also restyled with a mobile-friendly, centered UI.
    3.  **Editor Fixes:** The `Editor` component was repaired by:
        -   Fixing the TinyMCE configuration (`license_key: 'gpl'`) to enable the self-hosted version.
        -   Fixing the file loading logic to use the correct, user-selected repository from `localStorage`.
        -   Improving the save logic to correctly create new `text_block` sections in empty files.
    4.  **UX Improvements:** Post-save navigation was added to automatically return the user to the viewer. A true placeholder was implemented in the editor.
    5.  **Encoding Corruption Fix:** A critical bug that was double-encoding content on save was fixed by making the backend responsible for the final `btoa()` encoding. The frontend now sends plain text to the save endpoint.
-   **Thoughts & Questions:**
    -   The mystery of why the `Editor` component was mounting on the `FileViewer` page was never definitively solved, only worked around. This might indicate a subtle issue in the React Router setup that could be worth a future investigation.
    -   The editor's current logic combines all `text_block` sections into a single editable area. A significant future enhancement would be to create a true block editor where each section could be edited, reordered, or deleted independently.
    -   The application's state management for the selected repository relies on `localStorage`. Migrating this to a React Context would make the state more robust and easier to manage across components.
