# Easy SEO: Visual Website Builder

## Vision Overview

A no-code website builder for non-technical business owners (lawyers, plumbers, contractors) who want modern, SEO-optimized websites without needing coding skills. Built on free tools (GitHub, Cloudflare, Astro) with a visual editor that makes website creation as simple as editing a document.

-----

## Core Components

### 1. File Explorer (Home Base)

**What you see:**

- Welcome card for first-time users explaining the basics
- Folder structure that mirrors your website’s visitor journey
- Visual indicators showing:
  - **Red/Orange/Green** SEO health scores per page
  - **Published status** for each page
  - **Last modified** info from GitHub
- Home button (bottom right) to navigate back from any folder

**How folders work:**

- Folders = URL structure
- Example: A “Get” folder creates URLs like `lawyer.com/get/legal-help.html`
- Users see actual URLs during creation and preview

**Future enhancement:**

- Interactive sitemap showing visitor flow as a visual flowchart
- Migration tool to import existing websites (especially from cPanel/WordPress)

-----

### 2. Content Editor (Where Words Happen)

**Philosophy:** Content first, design second.

**Powered by TinyMCE** - A rich text editor that shows exactly what visitors will see:

**Basic formatting:**

- Headings, bold, italic, underline
- Lists, quotes, code blocks
- Tables and columns

**Smart features:**

- Auto-converts URLs to clickable links
- Drag-and-drop images with size/alt text controls
- Embed videos, audio, and other media
- Reusable content blocks (hero sections, features, quotes)
- Undo/redo with autosave

**Mobile-optimized:**

- Touch-friendly toolbar
- Tap-to-edit blocks
- Responsive interface for phones and tablets

**Workflow:**

1. Start with basic template
1. Edit content on left side
1. See design preview on right (mobile: two tabs)
1. Apply styles in Visual Editor

-----

### 3. Visual Editor (The Magic Layer)

**What it is:**
An interactive overlay where “what you see is what you get” - click, drag, and style your website in real-time.

**How it works:**

**The view:**

- Full-screen iframe showing your live preview
- Transparent overlay with bordered components on top
- Components update as you create content and apply styles

**Interactions:**

- **Single click** → Select element, show properties panel
- **Drag handles** → Move selected elements
- **Double click** → Edit content inline
- **Long press/right click** → Advanced options menu

**Component hierarchy** (in order of control):

1. **Layout** - Grid, flex containers, sections (the foundation)
1. **Components** - Heroes, cards, buttons, tables (building blocks)
1. **Elements** - Text, images, icons (the content)
1. **Styles** - Colors, spacing, effects (the polish)

**Settings panel** (context-aware based on selection):

- **Layout tab:** Position, size, spacing, alignment
- **Style tab:** Colors, borders, shadows, effects
- **Content tab:** Text, images, links
- **Advanced tab:** Custom CSS, animations, responsive behavior

**Technical approach:**

- Design changes saved as structured JSON
- Converted to Tailwind classes and CSS variables at render time
- Iframe and overlay communicate via message bridge (same-origin)
- Drag operations computed in overlay, applied via commands to iframe
- “Preview mode” toggles interaction on/off to prevent conflicts
